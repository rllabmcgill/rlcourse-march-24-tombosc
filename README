To run experiments:
- modify gym_train.py to give it the right environment (not available from command line) and pass the hyperparams in the command line.
- modify launch_exp.sh to run the grid search
- use visualize.ipynb to visualise results

Because the experiments generate a lot of data, I screenshot 3 pngs for the 3 environments.
